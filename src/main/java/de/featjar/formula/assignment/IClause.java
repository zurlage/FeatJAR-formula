/**
 * A clause; that is, a disjunction of literals or equalities.
 * Implemented as an assignment of variables to values, which are, by convention, interpreted as a disjunction.
 * That is, a clause is fulfilled if at least one variable matches its assigned value.
 * Thus, this class generalizes the notion of a clause in propositional logic to also account for first-order logic.
 * For a propositional implementation, see {@link BooleanClause},
 * for a first-order implementation, see {@link ValueClause}.
 * If you need a conjunction of literals or equalities, consider using a {@link ISolution} instead.
 *
 * @param <T> the index type of the variables
